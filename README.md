# boatMonitor

## Inspiration

I saw [this](https://l-36.com/DIY-boat-monitoring-system.php) on [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and thought "I can do that! And with surface mount components! And on only one board!!" So here we are

## The point of this project is two-fold:
1. To polish up my [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) skills as a portfolio builder.
	* Integrating an MCU and all of its attendant circuitry onto a design
	* Experiment with hierarchical design in Kicad, as I'm pretty used to Altium's approach
	* Experiment with split domain design, to maximize the safety of the relays on this board
2. To demonstrate that I can own a firmware project from start to finish.

## Additional info:
You'll likely need my customized components library to create this board. I haven't quite figured out how I want to do that yet, but once I do I'll update this space
